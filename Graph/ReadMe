Graph:
	unidirect (2 directions)
	directed: added directions using arrows
		cyclic (loop found here)
		Acyclic (Non-loop)

	labelling:
		unlableled
		vertises labeled
		edge labled 
	weights (nodes numbers with verises)
		weighted
		unweighted 
	sparsity
		spark : edges vs vertices will be equal
		dense : edges vs vertices will not be equal (full conncted graph)


Nodes are vertices
edges are connected lines
