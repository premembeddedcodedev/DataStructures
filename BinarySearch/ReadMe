		. properties:
			. Boundary Check
			. pair index property (start with even and end with odd index - because of adjascent element)
			. unique element property
			. partition property
	
	. Ceiling of the array
		. target has given, need to traverse array find equivalent or greater number.
		. LeetCode 744: Find smallest number graterthan target
	
	. floor of the array
