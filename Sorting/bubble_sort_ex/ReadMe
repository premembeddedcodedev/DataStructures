1. it can also know as(Aka) Sinking sort/exchangingsort

2. every inner loop will keep the higher/lower element in the end/start

3. space complexity - 0(1)

4. time complexity
	- worst case : o(n square) - if an array is un-sorted order or descending order
	- best case : o(n) - if an array is in already sorted order

5. when there is no swap in inner loop, then it consider as sorted array and you can break the full loop


TODO:
	- Need to check stable algo vs unstable (this question comes when 2 similar values in array with different features which one to keep 1st and 2nd if both values are similar)
